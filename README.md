# VideoOCR
In this Repository i am working on a project to extract OCR data from Video file uploaded

The purpose of this project is to extract OCR content from the document video uploaded by user, so that following things can be done
1. For each frame the summary of content in Video related to document can be generated
2. user can ask question from the documents available in Video
3. **This project can also be used for troubleshooting** in a use case of screen recording to determine if user is doing any installation or any task on system in correct way.

I will be continuosly updating this repository as my learning and this project progresses
